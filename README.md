# Streamlit Deployment Test

This repository contains a minimal Streamlit application built for the sole purpose of testing deployment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a simple, lightweight example to:

* Verify the deployment process on platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud.
* Confirm that dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` are installed correctly.
* Provide a basic "Hello, World!" template for future Streamlit projects.

## ðŸš€ Live App

You can see the successfully deployed app here:

## ðŸ›  What it Does

The app simply displays a title and a confirmation message to show that it's running successfully. It's not meant to have complex features.
